# Contributing to Linkora

Thanks for helping improve Linkora. To keep the project manageable, please follow these guidelines.

## The Golden Rule: Check the Label

* **"Open For Contribution"**: These are safe to pick up. They don't conflict with my current work.
* **No Label**: These are usually tasks I want to handle. If you really want to work on one, ask about it in the issue first, but be aware that it might already be in development.

## How to Start

1. **Find a Task:** Look for the "Open For Contribution" label.
2. **Claim It:** Comment on the issue so work isn't duplicated.
3. **New Features:** If it's not in Issues, **open an issue first**. Don't write code until I confirm I want it in the app.

## Development Guidelines

**Coding Style:** Match the existing code style. Consistency prevents unnecessary refactors. If the code looks like it belongs here, it's good.

## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

* **One Issue = One PR.** Keep them separate for easier merging.
* **Clear Titles.** Describe exactly what the PR does.
* **Verify it works.** Linkora is KMP. You **must** test on both **Android and Desktop** before submitting.
* **Tests.** Adding test cases with your submission is highly appreciated.
* **Description & Media.** Reference the issue. If you changed the UI, attach screenshots or a screen recording.
